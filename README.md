The code had to meet these conditions:

Built-in sorting algorithms are not allowed, developers have to implement sorting themselves if needed.

Unless stated otherwise, any algorithm/data structure can be used to solve the exercise, as long as it is implemented by the developer.

You are allowed to use std::vector and std::list in C++ as well as ArrayList and LinkedList in Java.

You must implement and use an AVL tree or a Red-Black tree.

Implemented data structures must be generic over the type of keys.
